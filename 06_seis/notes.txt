> seis covers function calls
  - functions allow for code reuse and bidirectional internaction w/ C and other compiled languages (i.e., write and call functions in C from assembly)
  - call operation: push EIP onto the stack (push location of NEXT instruction onto stack), then jump to location specified (location of function being called); pushes return location onto stack so can be easily returned from
