> tres files demonstrate jump instructions, creating conditions, and iteration
  - tres_jump.asm demonstrates an unconditional jump
  - tres_less.asm demonstrates a conditional jump using a less-then comparison
  - EIP: instruction pointer, holds location of execution, changed by jump operations (not add/sub operations like a register)
  - create label by ending identifier with a colon
    ex) skip:
> run commands:
  nasm -f elf32 tres.asm -o tres.o
  ld -m elf_i386 tres.o -o tres
  ./tres
  echo $?
> expected output:
