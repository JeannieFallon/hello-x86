> seven covers using ebp register to store stack pointer esp, and prologue + epilogue ebp/esp structure needed for nested function calls
  - ebp: base pointer register, can be used to hold value of esp
    * once original location of esp is stored in ebp, can allocate spaces on stack to execute a function and preserve original line of execution
  - prologue:
  - epilogue:
