> three files demonstrate jump instructions, creating conditions, and iteration
  - three_jump.asm demonstrates an unconditional jump
  - three_less.asm demonstrates a conditional jump using a less-then comparison
  - EIP: instruction pointer, holds location of execution, changed by jump operations (not add/sub operations like a register)
  - create label by ending identifier with a colon
    ex) skip:
  - jumps used after a comparison
    je  A, B  ; jump if equal
    jne A, B  ; jump if NOT equal
    jg  A, B  ; jump if A greater than B
    jge A, B  ; jump if A greater than or equal to B
    jl  A, B  ; jump if A less than B
    jle A, B  ; jump if A less than or equal to B
  - increment/decrement commands
    inc ++
    dec --

> run commands (change file name for each example):
  nasm -f elf32 three.asm -o three.o
  ld -m elf_i386 three.o -o three
  ./three
  echo $?
> expected outputs:
  three_jump   42
  three_less   42
  three_loop   11
